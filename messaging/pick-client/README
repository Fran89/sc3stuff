This is a minimalistic script to demonstrate how to connect to the
SeisComP 3 messaging and to receive and process messages. It handles
the very simple (nearly trivial) case of a pick and the only thing
is does is dump a few informations about the pick to stdout. If you
want to do something else with the pick (likely you do...), then
adopt the doSomethingWithPick() method accordingly.
