dumppicklist.py is a small utility to dump picks read from XML or
database to YAML. It is invoked

(1) either by specifying the database and an event ID, e.g. something like:

    dumppicklist.py -d mysql://... -E gfz2015....

or (2) by specifying an SC3 XML file and optionally an event ID, e.g.:

    - one event per XML file:

        dumppicklist.py --xml gfz2015abcd.xml

    - more than one event per XML file:

        dumppicklist.py --xml severalevents.xml

    - more than one event per XML file but dump one particular event:

        dumppicklist.py --xml severalevents.xml -E gfz2015abcd


dumppicklist.py is meant to be a starting point for own
modifications so please feel free to adopt it to your needs.
