make-xml-playback.sh - create files needed by scautoloc to run an
XML playback without connecting to the database

Usage: make-xml-playback.sh "$event" "$comment"

Based in the specified event ID, load all picks, manual and
automatic, plus the associated amplitudes, from the database and
dump them to an XML file. If present, also all *manual* origins
belonging to the event are dumped. These are not used normally but
can be used to simulate a manual location done by the user at any
time "during" the event.

The comment is optional.

BEFORE you run the make-xml-playback.sh script, you need to edit it
at the top to make the 'db' variable point to your SC3 database.
Normally you just substitute geofon-proc with localhost of you run
the script locally on your SC3 host.

The time window around the event is -20 ... +30 minutes relative to
the origin time, which is OK for teleseismic events. For playing
back local events, this time window may be adjusted at the top of
the dump-picks-to-xml.py script.

As scautoloc in offline mode also needs the station coordinates, we
dump these to a file, too, to make sure we have them available. For
completeness, we also dump the bulletin for the event.

The XML can then be used by scautoloc to play back the picks. This
is done by invoking make-xml-playback.sh with the only argument
being the event ID.
